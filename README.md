# HerbsReact

HerbsReact is an app where you can buy your favorite herbs. This is my first project written in react. I used Firebase and Tailwind to development.

## Description

You have a dozen different herbs and spices to choose from. To fully test the app, you need to create an account with an email and password (can be made up), or if you don't want to create a new account you can use a test account:

Email: 123@123.pl
Password: 123123

Now freely add and remove products in your shopping cart or favorites.
Every registered user has the ability to rate and write reviews about products. By clicking on the image of the product you will see information about it.
